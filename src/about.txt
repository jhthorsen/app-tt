A simple command line time tracker

"tt" is a time tracker tool, that is designed to not get in your way,
but rather do exactly what you need it to do, and nothing more.

Here is a common workflow, where you start tracking time, do some work,
and then stop the event at some later point:

  # -p defaults to the current working directory name
  # 08:00 defaults to the current time
  $ tt start -p work 08:00

  # Do some work
  $ $EDITOR src/main.rs

  # 17:00 defaults to the current time
  $ tt stop 17:00

At any time, you can inspect all previous events using the "report"
sub command or the current event with "status".

The "register" and "edit" commands can be used to add missed events
or change existing logged events.
